            <p>Halp is a website designed to connect high school students with college mentors.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
  
<p>I used HTML and CSS to design the front end and Parse for the back-end to store the data of students, including name, school, and major. I also used Javascript to set up email template using JQuery. We explored various business models, marketing plans, and monetization policies. Since gaining a user base is a critical factor in the success of our product, we discussed ways to attract users. We hypothesized forming partnerships with companies that appeal to college students, such as Starbucks or textbook companies. These companies could offer certain discounts for students in exchange for advertising. Also, a form of regulation could be implemented by having a rating system available for students to rate the quality of their interactions with their college mentors. After presenting our idea, we won "Second Place Overall" award out of nearly 300 attendees.</p>
