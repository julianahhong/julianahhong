			<h2>Vocap</h2>
            <h3>Free Agent</h3>
            <h3>Fall 2014 (5 months) | Catapult Social Entrepreneurship Incubator</h3>
            <p>Vocap is an early-stage foreign-language-learning startup developed in the Catapult Incubator at Wharton Business School.</p>
			
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>A major component of my work was further developing Vocap's brand identity. We worked with <a href="http://verynice.co">verynice</a>, a global design-strategy consultancy, to establish Vocap's aesthetic and vision. Through a branding workshop, we used techniques such as creating word and image clouds and constructing personas to flesh out our vision of Vocap’s character and target audience. Throughout the program, we communicated through weekly video calls to choose a suitable font, logo, and color palette. We used the Business Model Canvas to identify the problem we were targeting and refine our mission. Key skills we learned included the ability to “fail fast,” by recognizing our mistakes and sharing them with others, “pivot,” by seeking advice from our Wharton Business School mentors to change course, and “tell stories,” by connecting with others on an emotional level.

				<p>The program culminated in a pitch presentation on Demo Day. We won the "Most Investable Company/Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)" award.
