    <h1> Projects </h1>
    <h2> Computational Biology Research Assistant </h2>
      <p>I am working with Dr. Brian Chen and Ph.D. candidate Ziyi Guo at Lehigh University to develop VASP, volumetric alignment software applied to bone structures and electrostatic isopotentials of proteins. </p>

    <h2> Catapult Entrepreneurship Incubator </h2>
    	<p>I worked on a team of six to develop an early-stage startup called Vocap, an app that uses entertainment to teach foreign language vocabulary. Over the course of four and months and under the mentorship of Wharton Business School students, I gained hands-on experience with the Lean Startup model, branding, market research, and storytelling. </p>

    <h2>Mini Globetrotters</h2>
    	<p>During high school, I was co-director of an organization called Mini Globetrotters, a student-led community service club designed to spread multiculturalism to elementary students in the Lehigh Valley. I created <a href="http://lhsminiglobetrotters.me"> a website</a> for the organization from scratch and designed the logo using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
    <h2> MIT Blueprint Hackathon </h2>
    	<p>Over the course of 12 hours, I worked on a team of three to develop Halp, a website that connects high school students to college mentors. We used HTML/CSS to design the website and used Javascript to query a database set up with Parse. Our project won a Second Place award.</p>
