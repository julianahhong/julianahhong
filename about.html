	  <p>Today, there exists a gap in the education system regarding global awareness. There is far too little education on different countries and cultures. As a result, our graduates of public high schools are entering college and beyond ill-equipped to tackle the challenges of our increasingly globalized world.</p>
	  <p>Lack of funding due to educational budget cuts has drastically influenced the availability of after-school programs for elementary school children, opportunities that often spur creativity and foster intellectual stimulation nonexistent in traditional classroom.</p>
          <p><strong>We are trying to change that.</strong></p>

          <p>Mini Globetrotters is a student-led community service organization dedicated to spreading multiculturalism to elementary schools in the Lehigh Valley. The program is intended to make up for a lack of available after-school opportunities to local elementary school students. All of the activities, crafts, and snacks are made possible through donations and grant funding. Each member of the club earns hours for all related activities, including attending meetings, researching and creating lesson plans, preparing arts and crafts, and baking. All members have the opportunity to teach independently, or in a group, about the country or culture of their choice. The student-led club allows the members to develop strong leadership and management skills, all while enriching the minds of our young community members. The program truly benefits all participants.</p>
	  <p>All of the lessons plans are created and implemented by Liberty High School students who receive community service hours for their work. The Mini Globetrotters program is <b>free</b> to all participants. We fund all of our activities and supplies through donations and grants. </p>

          <p>The club was started in the 2004-2005 school year by Mrs. Cécile McKernan. The program started at Calypso Elementary School, and has since been held annually at James Buchanan Elementary School. In the Spring of 2015, it was brought to Marvine Elementary School for the first time. Since its inception ten years ago, Mini Globetrotters has served hundreds of elementary school students and contributed over 500 hours of community service.</p>
	  <p>For the 2014-2015 school year, Mini Globetrotters received the Summer of Service award hosted by Youth Service America. The two current student leaders, Georges Batoussi and Juliana Hong, devoted significant time throughout the summer to apply for the grant. In the past, Mini Globetrotters has run several summer programs at the Bethlehem Area Public Library.This year, they led an after-school program at Marvine Elementary School, covering countries, such as France, Germany, Peru, and Egypt. As of early March, they have begun teaching at James Buchanan Elementary School, the first time in the club’s history that two schools have been covered in the same school year. They also recently taught a Boy Scout troop about France and the french language which allowed them to earn their Diversity Badge.</p>
          <p>We leverage the diverse student population at Liberty High School by having teachers of many different backgrounds often teach about their native culture. This past year, we recruited students who had recently moved to the States from Afghanistan and South Korea to teach lessons and share a more personal perspective.</p>
