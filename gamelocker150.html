			<h2>GameLocker150</h2>
            <h3>HTML5 Game Developer</h3>
            <h3>Fall 2014 (2 months) | Lehigh University</h3>
            <p>GameLocker150 is a set of web games developed for the promotion of the Lehigh University/Lafayette College football rivalry.</p>
			
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>I developed the "Swimming" HTML5 Game using Construct 2. Our team collaborated with the Fusion Design Studio to create original art content. I was the only high school member of the team and took the project from ideation at the initial brainstorming meeting to execution. We decided to create a collection of mini-games to have Lehigh students "compete" against Lafayette students in common athletic events, including football, basketball, and swimming. I conceived of swimming mini-game with a "Flappy Bird" style. I started with low-fidelity paper-and-pen sketches and communicated my vision to the designers for their art production. Throughout the process of development and user testing, I added features, such as power-ups and a progressively increasing speed for the oncoming swimmers to make the game more challenging. I also initially thought of having subtle moving bubbles in the background to mimic movement, but we removed this feature to maintain a consistent, flat design across games. Our work was featured in articles and reached hundreds of users.</p>
