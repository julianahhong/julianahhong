            <h3>iOS App Developer</h3>
            <h3>Summer 2015 (8 weeks) | Make School NYC</h3>
            <p>Flashforward is an iOS app that allows users to capture moments and send them to the future.</p>
						
			
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I used Swift, Javascript, and Parse to code the iOS app, and I used Sketch to design high-fidelity wireframes. Using the Mandrill API, I created a mobile app that allows users to write a message and take or choose an existing photo to send to their email address at a future date. </p>

            <h3>Agile Methodology</h3>
            <p>Throughout the eight weeks, I practiced iterative design to continually improve the product. Every Friday included play testing our apps with our peers to get immediate feedback. We were also grouped into small teams to have "stand-ups" to discuss our progress. I started with a daily memory reminder idea but realized that daily notifications could easily become annoying and lead to a high attrition rate. I also thought of adding a social networking component to the app but decided against this because it required a user base to be usable. User testing brought key insights to light, causing me to remove the requirement for users to add a picture since this was seen as annoying, and adjusting the font size to make the text easier to read. </p>

			<p>The program culminated in Demo Day, where we pitched our idea to hundreds of people.</p>
